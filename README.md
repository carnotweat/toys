Just a simple toy problem : For loop  scripted (an illustrated with this toy problem)  to count number of files in a dir. Some media dirs have even 1000s of files and at times you don't just want the size of data to be transferred, but also the # of times an op will be executed, for various estimates.
Quick googeling does not quite help especially in highlighting the nuances and  [intricacies !](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/ParsingLs) of parsing the output of decpetively simple and common ls command, ignorance about which means leaving your steps and output to the mercy of shell, which may eat some of it based on how it operates.
One is not exposed to these by using ls a million times (although that may get one a paycheck), but by concieving such toy problems or stumbling at them out of quirks in
the way one operates, which however does not get one a paycheck and even kill the existing ones ....
Nontheless
Later: More commentory and versions, porting to different languages, which interest me and extrapolating it to nested dirs and illustrate recursion.
Next toy problem : Using functors for threading, used for multiplexing of downloading and a hell script that can execute bin files
